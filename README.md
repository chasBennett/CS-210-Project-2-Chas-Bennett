In response to the prompts provided to me by my professor in CS210 at SNHU, here are those prompts and my explanations / answers:

•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The Airgead Banking application is meant to simplify the process of calculating the interest one can earn on an initial investment by taking information about that investment and performing calculations to represent their earning potential. 
By giving the user the ability to change the values and repeat the calculations, multiple values can be entered to compare the potential of various combinations of starting investment, monthly contribution, interest rate, and number of years. 

•	What did you do particularly well?

Input validation is always of a high degree of importance on any coding project, so I paid particular attention to that. Throughout the application the input is validated to ensure that it will compile without errors and produce desirable results. 
In the event that invalid input is provided, prompts clearly articulate the error and the program prompts the user again. By ensuring that only valid input is allowed to be entered into subsequent methods, I’ve created stable code that will not crash.

•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

If I revisit this project, further enhancements would be needed to the UI. Currently, it is a simple console program that serves the purpose of providing investment calculations in a simple format. Minimal stylization is applied to the UI and the 
user experience could be greatly improved. By improving the UI, I could create a better user experience and add additional functionality to the application in an easy to understand format.

•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most difficult part of this project was actually the UI and style elements that I applied. It was a challenge to think about the various sizes the console can be, and to imagine ways to ensure that the layout will be centered in the console with 
asterisks and text aligned as intended. I wrote several methods to remedy this issue so that in subsequent versions I’ll be able to reuse this code and provide and consistent experience for users.

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This project gave me the opportunity to further practice and develop my skills with OOP programming, as well as gave me the opportunity to learn how to write code in C++. By learning the many ways of using OOP to create custom Classes and constructors 
in order to make secure and re-usable code, I am enhancing my skill set and preparing myself to be a meaningful contributor on larger projects with future employers.

•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

By creating methods for any code that might need to be repeated, and by passing in any variables to those methods, I’ve created a program that is highly adaptable and maintainable. By using the proper naming conventions for my methods and classes, 
I’ve ensured that other programmers and/or team members would be able to read the code and understand what it is doing. In addition to that, in-line comments throughout the code provide detailed explanation for what the code is doing.
